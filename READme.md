# Audio File Converter

This Python script allows you to convert audio files between different formats such as MP3, WAV, and others. It uses the `pydub` library, which acts as a wrapper around `ffmpeg` to handle the audio file conversion.

## Features

- Convert audio files from one format to another (e.g., MP3 to WAV).
- Supports various audio formats including MP3, WAV, OGG, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pydub` library
- `ffmpeg` (required by `pydub` for audio processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-file-converter.git
    cd audio-file-converter
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install pydub
    ```

3. Install `ffmpeg`:

    - **Windows**: Download and install `ffmpeg` from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Make sure to add `ffmpeg` to your system's PATH.
    - **Linux**: Install via package manager:
        ```sh
        sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
        ```
    - **macOS**: Install via Homebrew:
        ```sh
        brew install ffmpeg
        ```

## Usage

To convert an audio file, simply call the `convert_audio` function with the input and output file paths.

### Example:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
import os

def convert_audio(input_file_path, output_file_path):
    # Extract file extension to determine format
    input_format = os.path.splitext(input_file_path)[1][1:]  # Removes the dot (.)
    output_format = os.path.splitext(output_file_path)[1][1:]

    # Load audio file
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(input_file_path, format=input_format)

    # Export audio file in the desired format
    audio.export(output_file_path, format=output_format)

    print(f"Conversion successful! {input_file_path} -> {output_file_path}")

# Example usage:
convert_audio('input.mp3', 'output.wav')
Replace 'input.mp3' and 'output.wav' with your actual file paths.

Command Line Usage:
Alternatively, you can modify the script to accept command-line arguments for easier use:

sh
Copy code
python convert_audio.py input.mp3 output.wav
